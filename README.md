**Summary**

In the complex landscape of finance, the management and assessment of credit risk play pivotal roles in shaping investment strategies and influencing market dynamics. The finance problem at the heart of this research revolves around the need for a deeper understanding of credit risk within the context of bonds issued by companies listed in the S&P 500. As investors seek avenues to optimize their portfolios and financial institutions strive for effective risk management, the questions of what factors contribute to a bond's credit rating and how credit spreads can be predicted become paramount. In an ever-evolving financial environment, where market conditions and sentiment can swiftly impact investment outcomes, addressing these questions is not merely an academic pursuit but a practical necessity. The outcomes of this analysis hold the potential to refine credit risk assessment methodologies, offering tangible benefits for investors, financial analysts, and the broader financial ecosystem.
