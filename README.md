**Overview**

This analysis rigorously explores critical dimensions of credit risk based on a dataset compiled as of September 22, 2023, with a specific focus on bonds issued exclusively by S&P 500-listed companies. Encompassing essential information such as bond details, company fundamentals, credit ratings, and social sentiment indicators, the research addresses two central inquiries â€“ the determinants of a bondâ€™s credit rating and the predictability of credit spreads. Employing a linear regression model, the research introduces a model with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.2676 and an R-squared of 0.6965 in predicting credit spreads. Addtionally, utilizing an ordinal regression model, the study unveils key insights, highlighting the substantial impact of factors like credit spread, market capitalization, and debt-to-assets ratio on credit ratings. This comprehensive exploration offers valuable implications for investors and financial analysts navigating the intricacies of credit risk within the dynamic financial landscape.
